PLEASE MAKE SURE TO CREATE REPO IN THE CORRECT LOCATION.i.e inside javaBatch12 folder

2.intialzie the repo

3.Track all files by adding them to the staging area
Hint: you have to add all the files so use git add .

4. Make commit of all files in your local repo 
hint:
use git log to check the commit is there

 
5.goto github and create a new repo with name javaBasics
Hint:
we discussed in class that for each local we must a separate remote

-----------Establishing a connection--------------
6.on your terminal establish the connection with remote repo
Hint:
git remote add origin url--> make sure you enter the correct url
git remote -v to check if connection has been established
